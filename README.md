## Introduction

This project showcases a simple setup where a motor is controlled based on L298N. The data is processed by a microcontroller, which then adjusts the motor's operation accordingly.

## Componentes

- Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino, Raspberry Pi)
- Motor (DC motor, servo motor, or stepper motor)
- Motor driver (e.g., L298N, L293D, or any suitable motor driver)
- Power supply (appropriate for your motor and microcontroller)
- Jumper wires

## Setup

- Connect the L298N to the motor.
- Connect the motor driver to the microcontroller and the motor.
- Ensure the power supply is connected correctly to the motor driver and the microcontroller
